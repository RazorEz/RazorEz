Hi, Iâ€™m Ez Arhin. I hope you enjoy my journey to become the best Data Scientist I can be!

Here's a little about me:

I'm 22 years old, I'm from the UK and I have many years of experience in Python. 

I am a Data Science Degree Apprentice currently working within the banking industry, while working towards my undergraduate degree in Data Science. 

As of now, I have been working here for 3 years, and have about 2 more left before my degree ends. 

I'm interested in taking part in Hackathons and meeting like-minded people, so if you have any links then send them my way. 

Looking to collaborate on: 
   1. Data Science Projects
   2. Hackathons 
   3. Python projects
   4. Teaching
